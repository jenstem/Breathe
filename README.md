## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create an air quality app that would display a map of the city of my choosing.  The air quality app would allow the user to see what index of the air quality is in their chosen city.

The user can search the air quality for multiple cities.  When the user types a city into the search area and clicks the search button, the city is saved to local storage even if the user refreshes the page.  A list of searched cities is shown below the search button.  The user can click on a previous searched city and that city's air quality will populate again.

## User Story

AS A health-concerned person\
I WANT to see the air quality index for multiple cities\
SO THAT I can find a place to live and breathe easier

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a air quality app with form inputs\
WHEN I search for a city\
THEN I am presented with the current air quality index for that city and that city is added to the search history\
WHEN I view current air quality index for that city\
THEN I am presented with the city name, the air quality index, a map of the city, and a colored icon representating where on the air quality scale the city falls\
WHEN I click on a city in the search history\
THEN I am again presented with current air quality index for that city\
WHEN I type in the same city into search a second time\
THEN I can see that the city is not added to the search history a second time
